    %h4 What is the OpenNebula Marketplace?

    %p The OpenNebula Marketplace is a catalog of Virtual Appliances mainly posted by OpenNebula Systems that are ready-to-run on OpenNebula. The Marketplace has been created to simplify the deployment of Virtual Appliances and to support their distribution among the OpenNebula community. Not all the Virtual Appliances have been certified and so may be not ready to work on production environments.

    %h4 What is an OpenNebula Appliance?

    %p An OpenNebula Virtual Appliance is a pre-built software solution, consisting of a set of pre-configured virtual machine  image and configuration files, ready-to-run on an OpenNebula cloud.

    %h4 What is provided by the Marketplace?

    %p The Marketplace contains metadata that defines the Virtual Appliance but not the appliance files themselves. The   metadata includes the links to download the appliance files from third-party servers. The time required for Appliance   download is dependent upon network connection speed and the size of the Appliance files.

    %h4 What can I do in the Marketplace?

    %p You do not need to register to download public images. However you will need a GitHub Developer account to post your Virtual Appliances.

    %h4 Can I provide support for my Virtual Appliances?

    %p Yes, in the description of your Virtual Appliance, you can include support statements and link to resources to educate end users about your Virtual Appliance.

    %h4 How to ask questions about Virtual Appliance creation and posting or report problems?

    %p
      You can use
      %a{'href' => 'https://forum.opennebula.org/', 'target' => 'blank'}
        the OpenNebula forum
      for this kind of questions
